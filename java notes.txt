*JPA is a standard or set of guidelines provided by Java, which acts an interface for accessing, persisting and managing data 
between Java objects and relational databases. JPA is just an interface without any actual implementation to perform the action;here, 
Hibernate comes into the picture as a JPA provider and references implementation
 with the required underlying code to understand the JPA specification
and accomplish the operation against the database.Hibernate is an ORM framework that helps to map the objects and the relational 
database in the application. Hibernate is a superset of JPA that comes with multiple classes and methods to perform various 
other functionalities. However, JPA specification makes the application independent of ORM tool, and it is easy to switch the ORM 
tool from Hibernate to any other JPA provider such as EclipseLink 
or iBatis.You may refer to this link to understand the difference between JPA and Hibernate with an example.ImageHosterApplication
